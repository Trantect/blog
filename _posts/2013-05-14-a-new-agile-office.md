I always want to write down the process of setting up our office, working
environment and the processes. Now, we got a better opportiunity to log all
these interesting things: we are going to help a partner of us to setup their
office.

So, we will keep updating this blog with all the details, excepting the
confidential informations. Or, in another word, we will trace the process of
setting up in this blog, including ideas, issues and solutions. I believe
these information will be reused when we are moving to a new office (maybe soon), and may help somebody who is also wanting to set up an agile office.
