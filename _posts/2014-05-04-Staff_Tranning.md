## Object-Oriented Design Tool ##

On Mac or Linux-Based OS, the free open-source [UMLET](http://www.umlet.com) tool is used for object-oriented design. It includes all the graphical tool sets for UML diagrams.

You should understand the general software development process, including how to abstract user requirements into final code by applying UML. 

## Programming Language Tutorial ##

As the same as Natural languages, programming languages are designed as a combination of syntax and smeantics. As a professional programmer, the variances of languages should not be a problem for you.

Language is just a tool, such as arithmetic, for you to communicate with computer.

### Every Programer should know, but they may not know ###
We recommend the book called “Programming From The Ground Up” By Jonathan Bartlett. The sample codes in this book is assemble, however it is the best practice for you to understand how ancient programmer design and think of programming on nacked machine.

### C/C++ ###
You have to understand C/C++ even you don't program in it. Please go through [MIT online course on C++ and object-oriented programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-088-introduction-to-c-memory-management-and-c-object-oriented-programming-january-iap-2010/index.htm). The book called "[Thinking in C++](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Introduction-Standard-Volume-Edition/dp/0139798099)" will give you enough help.

### Java ###
Once you understand object-oriented in C++, Java should not be a problem for you at all.
- Online courses:[MIT online course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/index.htm)
- Books: [Thinking in Java](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Java-Edition-Bruce-Eckel/dp/0131872486)

### Python ###
- [Google Online course](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/?csw=1)
- [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython3.net)

### Javascript ###
You may use it on web programming, but is that what you think about it. You can read [this](https://github.com/PhoenixAndMachine/JS-Intro/wiki) and understand deeper about javascript.

### Nodejs ###
You can get all the resources from [nodejs community](http://nodejs.org).

## Linux extending to OS ##

To understand OS theory and to master linux are the compatible and unified process. More over, Linux is considered to be the best playground for you to understand Operating System. We here recommend you two books to read and play with, in order to grap the knownledge of Linux Operating system.
1. “The Linux Command Line” By William Shott
2. “Operating System Concepts” By Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin and Greg Gagne

## Git ##

There are several main-stream version control tools, such as svn, mercurial, and git, which we choose to use for collabrative work.
Go through [git docs](http://git-scm.com/documentation) to grap the general idea of git mechanism and usages in general scenarios.
