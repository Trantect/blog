# Trantect Blog at Github

Months ago, we set up a WordPress based blog at a VPS. But soon after that, we experienced a crash of the VPS and reinstalled the whole system. Even we backuped all the posts of WordPress, we didn't set up WordPress again at that VPS, since it's not safe.

So, months later, when we are working on the new design of our website, we decide to use Github + Jekyll for bloggin. And another great tool we found is prose.io, with which our colleagues will be able to create and edit pages without cloning the git repositoriy to local.
